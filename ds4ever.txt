Pluto, Pluto, two-door, four-door, man, this shit too easy (yeah)
Yeah, I'm gon' chop a brick like judo, snatch a Lamborghini (chop it up)
I got a different bitch for different places, different seasons (I do)
Bitch ain't playin' her position, cuttin' her off, this shit too easy
I started off smashin' R&B stars right at the bando
I'm havin' hoes all the way south thinkin' that I abandoned 'em
I have pimpin' in my blood and I can change the climate (Pluto)
I threw the Marni on and took the price up like I designed it (Pluto)
Can't put a Presidential on a bitch 'less she give a nigga a ménage ('nage)
That lil' IG bitch ain't shit, f*cked her in the car (car)
F*cked 'round with a side piece, pop out that night in double-R (what up?)
Started talkin' Chinese from all these sticks in the car
It's Young Wunna and Young Wheezy, man, this shit too easy
Different bitch for every season, showin' me they cleavage
I take drugs and feel relaxed, it's like they therapeutic
She text that pussy, I don't call back so she won't think I need it
